            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ALL thoſe that were famous in the Art of Phyſick, and by taking care of the health of Man gained to themſelves great Honor, may be ſuppoſed to have laid the firſt foundation of all their glory in the Cottages of Poor Men. For ſince two things chiefly commend a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian; skill to cure the ſick, and great charity to the Poor, without which there can hardly be ſo much ſence of anothers miſery that can invite one carefully to lend his utmoſt help. Theſe two are ſo united, that a Phyſitian can hardly be approved amongſt Rich Men and Princes, unleſs he hath ſhewed himſelf to be ſuch a one by his frequent Practice amongſt the Poor: For they that abound with all thoſe things, the want whereof makes life to others not ſo deſirable, will ſuſpect the skill of ſuch as begin, but now to Practice; and who have not been emnent by many experiments, and famous Cures, that are divulged by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb facs="tcp:154333:7"/>of the common People. And the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian alone ſhall not eaſily perſwade great Men, to whom he may be called, that he hath ſeriously taken care for the Diſeaſe, but rather for his own gain and profit, who hath not ſometimes done his beſt endeavors to help poor diſtreſſed Men, and by ſuch a Cuſtome, learned to deal gently with thoſe that are ſick. And this is the Cauſe, that, thoſe who begin to ſtudy Phyſick, and by the profeſſion of it, ſeek for renown and much profit, muſt in the firſt place make it their greateſt care, that when by ſtudy they have learned the precepts of Phyſick, they may know how to apply it to Men of mean fortunes that are Sick; and from thence they may happily begin their firſt Practice. In which buſineſs, a ſmal eſtate is no little hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the endeavors of the Phyſitian, when oftentimes not only fit Nouriſhments cannot be afforded to ſuſtain the ſtrength of Nature, but alſo fit Remedies for the Cure; much dear and coſtly Phyſick fetched out of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries Shops, would undo the Poor and ſo make a new addition of more miſery to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Nature is liberal to provide for the neceſſities of the Poor, and hath ſent forth many matters for Medicaments, that may be found almoſt every where, and with little Art may be prepared for every uſe. In which a Phyſitian ought to be as wel skilled, as he ſhould be in Medicaments that are for the Rich as <hi>Galen</hi> writes, <hi>6. de Comp. Medicam. Per Loca. Cap. 1.</hi> Eſpecially ſince thoſe Obvious
<pb facs="tcp:154333:7"/>Remedies are not onely profitable for the Poor, But as neceſſary for the Rich, when they are upon a Journey, if perchance they ſhould fal ſick, when they are farr from Cities, and Apothecaries Shops. This Treatiſe therefore ſhal be concerning ſuch Remedies as are eaſie to be procured. Thus far <hi>I</hi> have followed in this Epiſtle the Expreſſions of the Famous and Learned <hi>Doctor, John Prevotius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My intent in Publiſhing Books of Phyſick in Engliſh is not to make Fooles Phyſitians. but to help thoſe that are Ingenious, Rational and Induſtrious, though they have not that knowledg of Tongues that were to be deſired. I have and ſhal in my Books of Phyſick follow the moſt Honeſt and Learned in that Art; But let me warn thee now (as I have often before) That there is great danger in Phyſick if they be not rightly prepared and given in their due quantities. And alwaies remember, thou ſhalt give an account to God for al thy actions done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſhal ſay no more but this; I am reſolved not to give over, until I have Publiſhed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh whatſoever ſhal be neceſſary to make an Induſtrious, Diligent, Rational Man a knowing Phyſitian. This is the aim and indeavor of.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great are the Afflictions wherewith our <hi>Heavenly Father</hi> hath been pleaſed to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe me his poor <hi>Hand-maid,</hi> that I have not only lived to ſee my <hi>dear Husband,</hi> (the <hi>Stay</hi> and <hi>Solace</hi> of my Life) taken from me: but it hath been my hard hap alſo to ſee his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> (which will be dear to all Poſterity, for the Works he hath written for the Common Good of this Nation) blemiſhed, and Eclipſed, by the <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>unjuſt Forgeries</hi> of one, Who, though he calls himſelf <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel,</hi> is far from being <hi>an Iſraelite in whom there is no guile;</hi> who was not content to publiſh a <hi>Hodg-podg</hi> of <hi>indigeſted Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> of my dear Husband deceaſed, under the Title of <hi>Culpeper's laſt Legacy;</hi> but to make the Deceit more taking, he ſteeled his Forehead ſo far, and braſed it ſo hard, as not to be aſhamed to forge <hi>two Epiſtles,</hi> one in mine, and the other in my Husbands Name; of the penning of which, he nor I, never ſo much as dream'd: And yet he <hi>impudently</hi> affirmeth in my Name, that my Husband <hi>Laid a ſevere Injunction on me to publiſh them for the general Good, after his deceaſe; and
<pb facs="tcp:154333:8"/>that they are his laſt Experiences in Phyſick and Chyrurgery.</hi> And in the Title of his Book, he ſaith, <hi>They are the choyceſt, and moſt profitable Secrets, reſolved never to be publiſhed till after his Death.</hi> All which Expreſſions in the Title and Epiſtles, are as falſe as the Father of Lyes; and every word in them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and feigned. And he knew well enough, that no diſcreet, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, that was a friend to my Husband, or me, would ever have agreed to ſuch infamous and diſhoneſt Practices; and therefore I deſire all Courteous Readers of the Writings of my Husband, to take notice of this <hi>Deceit,</hi> and to aſſure themſelves that it never entred into his head, to publiſh ſuch an undigeſted <hi>Gallimoffery,</hi> under the promiſing and ſolemn Name of his <hi>Laſt Legacy,</hi> and that <hi>whereby he gained his Reputation in the World,</hi> as the Impoſter makes him ſpeak in his forged Epiſtle. And I deſire any indifferent Reader, that hath obſerved my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands lofty, and Maſculine manner of expreſſing himſelf in his Prefaces, and Epiſtles Dedicatory, whether in caſe he had been minded or diſpoſed to take ſo ſolemn a farewel of the world, as the <hi>Forger</hi> makes him to do; whether, <hi>I</hi> ſay, he would have done it in ſuch a <hi>whining faſhion,</hi> and ſo in the Stile of a <hi>Ballade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>And now, if it pleaſe Heaven to put a period to my Life, and Studies, that I muſt bid all things under the Sun farewel: Farewel to my dear Wife and Child, farewel Arts and Sciences, farewel all worldly Glories, adieu Readers.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly my Husband would have been far more ſerious, and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in ſuch a caſe, as any diſcreet man will judg. Neither can it be thought, that in ſuch a ſolemn <hi>Valeduction,</hi> he could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly forget his wonted respects to the <hi>Colledg of Doctors,</hi> to whom he did ſo frequently addreſs himſelf, in divers of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courteous Readers, I</hi> ſhall ſay no more touching the abuſe of the Book-ſeller, only to prevent (as much as concerns me) thy being abuſed for the future, know, That my Husband left ſevey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-nine Books of his own making, or Tranſlating, in my hands, and "I have depoſited them into the hands of his, and my much Honored Friend, Mr. <hi>Peter Cole,</hi> Book-ſeller, at the <hi>Printing-Preſs,</hi> neer the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> (for the good of my Child) from whom thou mayeſt expect to receive in Print, ſuch of them as ſhall be thought fit to ſerve thee in due ſeaſon, without any Diſguiſes or Forgeries, unto which <hi>I</hi> do hereby give my atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>Moreover, of Hellebore they prepare a double extract, one more effectual then the other.</p>

               <p>Beſides theſe, the Pouder of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone doth profit well, or the Flower mixt and taken with a rear Egg. The Seed of Nettles mixed in Lohochs, or Aqua-vitae with a third part of Sugar, made into a confection, or mixt with

               <p>Alſo <hi>Theriaca Diateſſaron</hi> is eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Take Roots of Gentian and Juneper berries, (but againſt Poyſon I ſhould prefer Bay-berries) Mirrh, Roots of round Ariſtolochia of each two ounces, clarified Honey two pound, make an Electuary.</p>
               <p>There are alſo famous Pouders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Poyſons and the Plague, that are eaſily made: as that which is called <hi>Griſeus Caeſaris,</hi> and <hi>Saxonicus,</hi> the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions whereof are to be found in Wickerus <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Antidot.

               <p>This vineger alſo is good againſt Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and the Plague.</p>
               <p>Take Roots of wild Angelica dried
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:154333:88"/>in the ſhade, Juniper Berries of each one ounce, mirrh half an ounce, Leaves of Rue one pugil, Cinnamon one dram; bruiſe all groſely, and infuſe them and digeſt them for eight days in the beſt Vineger, (Roſe Vineger is better) one pound and an half, then ſtrain it, and take every morning one ſpoonful faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Outwardly they commend a Radiſh cut in peices, and born under the Arme-pits, provoking the Patient to ſweat in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Theſe Oyls are famous of the great Duke, of Scorpions of <hi>Mathiolus,</hi> in the Room whereof, other Oyls not ſo hard to make, and of as much vertue may be compounded. As,</p>
               <p>Take Oyl of ripe Olives (the riper the better) three pound, white Wine ſpiced one pound and an half, Roots of Gentian, Tormentil, Maiſter-wort, Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-wort common Angelica, of each one ounce, tops of St. Johns-wort, Leaves of Tobacco, and Rue, of each one handful, grains of Juniper and Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries of each half an ounce, make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion according to art for ſpur days in a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:154333:88"/>veſſel very well ſtopt, then let them Boyl til the moiſture be almoſt ſpent, preſs them out, and ſtrain them.</p>
               <p>Againſt bitings and wounds that are venemous, inward Antidotes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, mixt with cordials.</p>
               <p>But outwardly the ſame are good mingled with attractives, that draw the Poyſon to the wounded part, and keep the wound open, til the venom be purged out; ſuch are all the hotter Agents and Rubificatives, of which we ſpeak elſe where.</p>
               <p>But properly Antidotes are, Ammi, Seed, long Ariſtolochia, Bdellium, both Dictamni, the Roots of both ſword-flags, the brains of Dunghil-Cocks, Origanum, Pimpernel, Saxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, Root and Seed of the Clot-Bur, Goats-Rue, Goats-beard, and the Leaves of all kinds of Scorzonera, and the Juyce of the Roots; all thoſe are taken in hot white Wine.</p>
               <p>The Antidotes that I ſet down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Poyſons taken, do almoſt the ſame thing: But this muſt be generally taken notice of, that the fleſh of any Venemous Creature layed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:154333:89"/>to the biting or wound, that that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made, doth draw out the venom: whence it comes to paſs that the Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of water Serpents, but eſpecially of Vipers is ſo famous, againſt the poyſon of al Serpents; and if we may beleeve report, it is good to cure and to preſerve alſo againſt al venoms, ſo that if the pouder be once taken to half a dram in ſpiced Wine; ſome maintain that the body is made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable againſt al poyſons for many days.</p>
               <p>This pouder is prepared three waies, and firſt thus.</p>
               <p>Take the Heart, the Liver, and the three firſt back bones of a Viper or wood Snake, dry all in an Oven, beat them into Pouder, add the root of Maiſter-wort an equal part and mingle them.</p>
               <p>Secondly Vipers fleſh, the entrals being taken out (except the Heart and the Liver) muſt be cut, and ſeaſoned eight days with Salt, then put al into a Sive that is wel guarded on every ſide, and underneath rayſe a ſweet perfume, four or five times a day conſtantly,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:154333:89"/>caſting on fire coles, the pouder of Myrrh, Bay-berries, grains of Juniper and Cloves, and when the fleſh is found to ſmel very wel, put it into a glaſed pot, wel covered with a cover of clay, and put it into a Bakers oven, and let it ſtay there, until al the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the fleſh with the bones can be brought into a moſt fine pouder: the new Phyſitians aſcribe more vertue to this pouder than to the antient confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Theriac or Mithridate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Vipers fleſh being excellent wel waſhed in white Wine, ſaving the Heart, and the Liver, muſt be gently dried that it may be beaten to pouder, and ſo uſed by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, the poyſon of mad Creatures hath certain Antidotes, with which, being taken for forty days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the wound in the mean while being kept open, madneſs and fear of water is quite driven away. Theſe are, Madwort, the aſhes of river Crabs, the root of the wild roſe, and common Pimpernel. They are given alone or mingled from one dram to two drams, in white Wine, they are mingled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:154333:90"/>with the root of Gentian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> provides his Antidote of one part of Frankinſence, Gentian five parts, and ten parts of river Crabs burnt.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſome report, that this pouder is proved by experience, to cure the fear of water, given in white Wine from half a dram to two drams, dayly three hours before meat.</p>
               <p>Take Leaves of Polypode, Rue, Vervin Sage, Plantain with narrow Leaves, Leaves of common Wormwood, Mints, Mugwort, betony, Balm, St. Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Centaury the leſs, of each equal parts, dry them in a paper and beat them to Pouder.</p>
               <p>Thus far concerning remedies that oppoſe the principal cauſe of the diſeaſe, from the taking away whereof; the cure of material diſeaſes muſt begin, unleſs there be ſomthing elſe that is urgent and ſo draws the cure to it: for that muſt be preſenly taken care for, neglecting the cauſe and the diſeaſe for a time, if that urgent thing gives no delay, but threatens the patient with ſudden death.</p>
               <p>Now theſe things are ſaid to urge
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:154333:90"/>immediately and by it ſelf principally; the weakners of the vital ſpirits, in all faintings and ſwounings; but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and ſecondly all vehement pains, continual watchings, all immediate Evacuations, from whence there is fear of the diſſolutions of the ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Theſe things urging, ſuch remedies as ſtrengthen the ſpirits muſt be ſet againſt them, ſuch as eaſe pain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure reſt, ſtay fluxes; if the diſeaſe or the principal cauſe, by reaſon of its violence, and the weakneſs of the ſick, do ſometime come to be urgent; as feveriſh heat in an Old man, and the thickneſs and clammineſs of flegm, in an exquiſite quotidian Feaver, they require no other remedies than ſuch as are of themſelves contrary, concerning which we have partly ſpoken, and we ſhall ſpeak ſomething afterwards in the number of remedies that alter diſeaſes.</p>

               <p>In a hot cauſe, cold or temperate ſents muſt be prepared, ſuch as are made of Vineger, Roſes, Camphir, Violets, Mirtils, the Pills of ſweet Apples, and Quinſes that are grown Yellow.</p>
               <p>Vineger altered with theſe ingredients is the beſt, making infuſion for ſome hours, or gently Boyling them, alſo to alter the Ayr, water muſt be ſprinkled in the Chambers that is mingled with Vineger, and it is good for ſents to put to the Noſe.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:154333:91"/>
               <p>In a cold cauſe, ſmels muſt be made of the flowers of Citrons, Oranges, Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the Clove-gelli-flowers, Jeſamin, Lillies of the Valleys, Roots of Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, Ciperus, Carden ſetwal, Leaves of Calamint of the Mountain, Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, Balm, Mint, Roſemary, Spik, Lavender, Time, Citron Pills, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Juniper berries, and all kind of Spices;</p>

               <p>Such as eaſe pain are threefold: namely ſuch as cure by taking away the cauſe of pain; proper Anodynes, which letting the cauſe alone, yet aſſwage the ſenſe of the part; and ſtupefactives, that wholy take away the feeling of it, or elſe caſt the ſick into a ſleep.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that cure, belong not to this place, for they are as large in extent as diſeaſes and the cauſes of them, by which the continuity of the part may be diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Proper Anodynes are, Marſh-mallows, ſweet Almonds, warm water, Dill, green Chamomel, Fenugreek, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, Mallows, Melilot, Yolks of Eggs, fat Broth.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, for Fomentations out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, are convenient, living creatures their entrals being taken out whilſt they are hot, the Lungs and the kel, of living creatures, water and Oyl, greaſy Wooll, Sheeps Milk and Cows Milk hot, wheaten Bread moderately baked and yet hot.</p>
               <p>For Unguents, Hogs fat, Hens fat, Calfs fat, Mans fat, Butter, Suet, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage of Lin-ſeed Mallows, Marſh-Mallows,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:154333:92"/>Fenugreek, and Oyls made of the ſaid Herbs and Seeds Boyled in them.</p>
               <p>But beſide common anodines, there are ſome others that do properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſome certain parts, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be called ſpecifical anodines.</p>
               <p>For the pain of the Head from what cauſe ſoever, this Oyl is moſt effectual.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the Juyce of Vervain very well puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied two pound, ſimple Oyl of Roſes one pound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſtil it at a gentle fire of Embers, let the diſtilled Liquor be poured on again, and diſtilled again, and ſo do three times; for the Juyce will mingle with the Oyl inſeparably, and in that, being warm, dip in a Linnen Clout to lay to the Forehead, and anoint the Sutures.</p>
               <p>For pain of the Teeth. The Oyl of Box diſtilled by deſent is extolled.</p>
               <p>For the pain of the Chollick, a ſure remedy is, one dram of a Mans Skull prepared, and taken with one ſcruple of Armis Seeds, in a cold cauſe: but with Coriander Seed if the cauſe be hot.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:154333:93"/>
               <p>Alſo the pouder of the Teſticles of a gelded Horſe, taken to one dram, after the ſame faſhion.</p>
               <p>This Oyl is exceeding good for the pain of the Hemorroids.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Fig-wort four ounces, great Celon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine two ounces, the Sponges that grow on the ſweet Eglantine, in number four, Seed of Agnus Caſtus two drams, common Oyl two pound.</hi> Cut the Roots, bruiſe the reſt grosſly, ſet them in the Sun for a month, and keep them for uſe: Or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them for eight days in a hot place; then Boyl them til the moiſture be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and make expreſſion, and after that ſtrain them.</p>
               <p>For pain of the Breaſt, the Oyl of Lin-ſeed drank two or three ounces is ſingular.</p>
               <p>For pain of the Joynts this Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is approved.</p>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:154333:93"/>half an ounce, and dip a Linnen Cloth in it and lay it hot to the part.</p>
               <p>Narcoticks indeed laid to the part do ſtupefie, but being taken or ſmelt to, or applyed to the head, they cauſe ſleep. They differ in the intenſion of their quality, from properly called ſleeping Medicaments, becauſe theſe by their moderate coldneſs and moiſture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſleep, but thoſe by the exceſs of both qualities bring out deep ſleep, and if they be uſed too largely they cauſe Carus and Apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Yet there is ſome degrees of theſe Narcoticks, for ſome are more gentle; the uſe thereof is not ſo dangerous; ſome are more violent, which muſt not be uſed but upon very urgent pains and watchings.</p>
               <p>The more gentle to be uſed inwardly, are white Poppy Seed, to about one dram; but outwardly in Lotions, the Leaves of Garden Night-ſhade and Poppy.</p>
               <p>The more violent, are Hemlock, white Henbane, <hi>Mandragora, Opium,</hi> round <hi>Stramonium;</hi> Black Henbane, and long <hi>Stramonium,</hi> are beſt to be let
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:154333:94"/>alone, by reaſon of the great hurt they do to the Bowels.</p>
               <p>Of others, are made fit ſents and Loti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the Feet and the Head; but inwardly, only <hi>Opium,</hi> and round <hi>Stramonium,</hi> may be uſed.</p>
               <p>The Seed of <hi>Stramonium</hi> is given in ſubſtance from half a ſcruple to one ſcruple, or thereabouts; but infuſed from one ſcruple to two ſcruples, it is corrected with good Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opium</hi> is given from two grains to five, corrected with Saffron, or Popper, and ſo made into a Pill, or infuſed in the beſt Wine. <hi>Oriental Opium</hi> is ſomthing ſtronger than <hi>Opium</hi> of our Country; but becauſe outlandiſh <hi>Opium</hi> is often brought to us Sophiſticated, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is ſold very deer, it were better to make it pure of our own Country; Poppy, after the way that <hi>Quercitanus</hi> hath taught us. Take what quantity you pleaſe of Garden Poppy Heads, that carrieth a red flower, ſo ſoon as the firſt flowers appear diſplaied; bruiſe them in a Stone Morter with a woodden Peſtle: put the matter into a ſpacious Glaſs, and pour on ſo much
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:154333:94"/>of the beſt white Wine Vineger, til the matter be very wel wet, &amp; the Vineger ſwim above al, two fingers breadth; let them digeſt for about fifteen daies, and when the Vineger grows red intenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, put the matter into a Linnen Bag, and preſs it out ſtrongly: what is expreſſed let it Evaporate at a gentle fire to the conſiſtence of Honey, and whilſt it is yet hot, caſt it into cold water, that it may Coagulate; then take it out and wipe off the moiſture.</p>
               <p>But of compounds there are two that are the beſt, and eaſieſt to be provided of all that are found in ſhops.</p>
               <p>The firſt is of Guajnerus for outward uſe.</p>
               <p>Take Opium, <hi>Juyce of Henbane, Juyce of Mandragora, of unripe Mulberries, Lettice, and of Ivy Tree, of each one ounce.</hi> Diſſolve the <hi>Opium</hi> in the Juyces, when that is diſſolved, wet a Sponge in it, and dry it again, at the Sun, for fifteen daies, when you would uſe it, dip your Sponge in warm water, and put it to the Noſe of the Patient, this Sponge will keep its vertue for ſome years.</p>
               <p>The other ſerves for internal uſes,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:154333:95"/>namely <hi>Laudanum,</hi> which in two daies time may be made. Thus,</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the extract of Saffron one ſcruple, the extract of the ſpecies of Diamoſchu two ſcruples, extract of</hi> Opium <hi>prepared four ſcruples.</hi> Mingle them, <hi>and with three drops of diſtilled Oyl of Cloves, ſoften it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saffron and ſpecies are extracted with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> but the <hi>Opium</hi> with diſtilled Vineger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opium</hi> alſo is prepared, if it be cut thin, and dried at a gentle heat, ſo long until it will fume no longer, and being rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed between the Fingers, will crumble to Pouder: the Doſe of this is from about one grain and an half, to five grains; it eaſeth pains, ſtops long Watchings, and ſtaies immoderate and ſharp Fluxes.</p>
               <p>Alſo Narcoticks provoke ſleep, but far more vehemently than true ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remedies do, by ſo much as deep ſleep requires ſtronger means than ſleep doth: whence it is, that when true ſleeping Medicaments will not prevail, we are forced to uſe Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or heavy ſleeping remedies now mentioned.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:154333:95"/>
               <p>True ſleeping Remedies, are, ſweet Almonds, and the Emulſions of them, all ſorts of Milk, Garden Lettice, freſh Moſs of Trees, Water Lillies, great Houſleek, Blew Violets, Venus Navel, and ſmal Wine mixed well with pure Water: the Exhibition of theſe is ſeveral.</p>
               <p>Fleſh Broths are altered with Lettice and Violets.</p>
               <p>An Emulſion of ſweet Almonds is made with the Decoction of Lettice; Lettice is eaten Boyled, ſeaſoned with the Juyce of Oranges, or Pome-citrons, or Lemmons.</p>
               <p>Decoctions are made of Herbs for Lotions of the Head and Feet.</p>
               <p>Alſo an unguent may be made to anoint the Noſtrils and the temples, ſuddenly with Oyl. thus,</p>
               <p>Take <hi>theſe Herbs, Lettice, Water Lillies, great Houſleek, Garden Night-ſhade, of each one handful: common Oyl eight ounces.</hi> Boyl them at a gentle fire, til the moiſture be conſumed; preſs them out, and ſtrain them.</p>
               <p>The Oyl of Violets and Water Lillies of the ſhops ſerve for the ſame uſe.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:154333:96"/>
               <p>All thoſe things ſerve to ſtop Fluxes, which ſtay the matter that is moved with an ill motion; by repelling it, pulling it back, intercepting it, and binds up the paſſages; therefore they belong not to this place.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things that are moſt proper to ſtay Fluxes, ſhall be mentioned in the Catalogue of aſtringents.</p>
               <p>There remains therefore, to number up thoſe Medicaments that drive away Diſeaſes; the uſe whereof is moſt fit after the cauſes that are urgent are taken away: now of Diſeaſes there are three general Heads; Diſtemper, ill Conformation, and Unity diſſolved.</p>

               <p>Though there be eight ſickly kinds of diſtempers, four that are ſimple, and ſo many Compound; yet it is not neceſſary to make eight ſorts of altering Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe Compound diſtempers
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:154333:96"/>are cured with ſimples that alter, being mingled together, and ſo as need requireth they make a Compound quality; then becauſe amongſt ſimple qualities, moiſture and drineſs are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken away with hot or cold remedies for Excrementitious moiſture is cured, both with hot things that rarefie and conſume, as alſo by cold things that preſs out, and by dry things of both kinds that ſtay moiſture.</p>
               <p>But ſickly drineſs, being it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a want of native moiſture, which cannot be reſtored with Phyſick, but with Nutriment, is better cured by good Diet, and ſome heat reſtored in the part that is dried, by the benefit whereof the blood may be drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and more eaſily digeſted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be ſufficient to ſet down Medicaments that heat the parts that are over cooled, and ſuch as cool the parts over heated: for both theſe being mingled together, it will be an eaſie matter to Compound an active, temperate remedy, and which is, amongſt the paſſives, moiſt and dry, as neceſſity and the diſtemper that muſt

               <p>Moreover, ſeeing there are two kinds of altering Medicaments, ſome are certain, by which ſome certain parts ſeem to be moſt affected; others are uncertain, which work indifferently upon the whole Body; it will be ſufficient to propound ſuch altering Remedies that are certain; becauſe the diſtemper of the whole Body, follows the hurt of ſome Principal part, the Remedies whereof bring help alſo to the whole Body.</p>

               <p>Wines are prepared by the infuſion of the ſame Herbs, and they wil be better, if you add ſteel that is prepared with Brimſtone, which preparation may be made ſuddenly, as for example.</p>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:154333:117"/>Rue Savory, Sage, wild Time, French and Italian Spik; ſweet Tanſey, Time, and all Spices, amongſt which the beſt are Cinnamon, Saffron, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langa, Mirrh, Mace and Nutmeg.</p>
               <p>The Pouder of theſe may be given, to one dram in Spiced Wine or Broth, or elſe Electuaries may be made of them, adding thrice as much of Clarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Honey.</p>
               <p>To this end ſerve all kind of Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Spices, that may be had at cheap rates, of which take one dram in Wine.</p>
               <p>But Decoctions and Phyſical Wines are preferred before other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe by reaſon of their moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they can more eaſily be conveyed to the Matrix.</p>
               <p>The beſt Decoctions are made of Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon Broth, the Belly of the Pidgeon being ſtuft with the ſaid ſimples, as for Example.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Herbs, Calamint, Penniroyal, Balm, Mints, of each one handful, tops of Roſemary and Lavender, of each one pugil, Bay-berries, Nutmeg and Galanga, of each one dram.</hi> Cut the Herbs and bruiſe the reſt groſsly,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:154333:118"/>and put them together within the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Pidgeon; then boyl them in water ſufficient at a very ſoft fire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the fleſh be perfectly boyled; then preſs all out ſtrongly, and ſtrain it: give two ounces of it, or thereabouts, daily for many daies.</p>
               <p>Phyſick Wines are made by the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſaid Ingredients, or by thrice pouring the wine upon the ſaid pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders put into a long bag.</p>
               <p>Women uſe to provide Wines by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and that preſently, but they are not ſo effectual, becauſe the thinner parts are evaporated.</p>
               <p>Alſo to drink the water of Baths from Brimſtone ſeaſonably, doth wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maintain and correct the heat of the Matrix.</p>
               <p>Outwardly do profit, Inſeſſions, Bath waters from Brimſtone, or Baths altered with the ſaid Herbs, putting into the Matrix a hollow Pipe, that by that, the force of the Medicament may come to it.</p>
               <p>The ſame Liquors, as alſo Phyſical Wines are conveniently uſed, conveied by injections to the ſecrets.</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:154333:118"/>
               <p>Alſo Fumigations of Spices and ſweet Herbs are good.</p>
               <p>Peſſaries are commended, ſuch as may be preſently provided, Thus.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the Pouder of Bay-berries and Rue, of each one dram, Mirrh half a dram, Juyce of Fetherfew or Peniroyal or Spiced Wine one ounce.</hi> Mingle them, and with carded Wooll or Cotton make a peſſary. <hi>Or,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take <hi>the beſt Honey one ounce, Juyce of Mugwort half an ounce.</hi> Boyl them to a fit conſiſtence, then add Pouder of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langa, or the Spices of vulgar Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks one dram: mingle them for a peſſary.</p>
               <p>Alſo Fomentations muſt be applyed to the lower part of the Belly, with Spounges, preſſed out with mineral waters, or of the Decoctions of the foreſaid ſimples, chiefly in ſtrong Wine.</p>
               <p>But no Fomentation is better, than the mud of hot Baths applyed to that part for ſome daies.</p>
               <p>Anoint the ſame place with Oyl of Spik, Bays, Rue, and other things made of the Decoction of the ſaid ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as for example.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Herbs Calamint, Marjoram, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therfew,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:154333:119"/>Mints, Lavender, of each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Bay-berries and Galanga, of each two drams.</hi> Pound what muſt be pounded, and infuſe all in one pound and an half of common Oyl and half a pound of Spiced Wine for ſix hours, then Boyl them at a ſoft fire till the moiſture be conſumed.</p>
               <p>Some aſcribe a peculiar vertue to ſtrengthen the Matrix, to Santoline, which <hi>Mathiolus</hi> makes to be Foemale Southernwood.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the moſt common and ready Remedies to alter, whereby the diſtemper of every part, and of the whole Body may be corrected.</p>

               <head>Remedies of Diſeaſes in ill Conformation.</head>
               <p>Due Conformation, convenient Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Similary parts, of which the Organ conſiſts, do make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Organ; alſo convenient and fit number to which apt connexion is referred: therefore we ſhall Recite four chief heads of faulty compoſition,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:154333:119"/>namely, a Diſeaſe in conformation, in Magnitude, in number, in Scituation.</p>
               <p>There are four ill accidents that befal Conformation: namely, in figure, the inſenſible paſſage, being open or ſhut, Cavity or ſenſible paſſage being enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or ſtreightened, and the ſuperficies being ſmooth or rough.</p>
               <p>A Diſeaſe in figure hath no Remedies that are proper for it, but it is either cured with the help of Chirurgery, or with Medicaments that reſpect other Diſeaſes, on which it dependeth. For it is made either by faulty Conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Womb, or violent motion in the birth, or the unſkillful ſwathing by Midwives, or walking when the Legs are weak, disjoyntings, and errours of the Chirurgion in curing Fractures and Luxations, which want the help of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, but of thoſe we do not ſpeak in this place.</p>
               <p>But the part brought again to its due Conformation is ſtrengthened out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with Fomentations and Cerates, which are made of Aſtringents, but chiefly thoſe that are hot, and ſhall be deſcribed very ſhortly.</p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:154333:120"/>
               <p>Now if the figure be ſpoiled by too great <hi>Repletions,</hi> or extream in any Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, or by ſome inclinations of one part toward another, by reaſon of a Palſy or Convulſion, as it falls out when the Nerves or the Tendons are cut, or from ſome hard Cicatrice, or great ſwelling; it is cured by ſuch Remedies as empty, ſtrengthen the Nerves, ſoften hardneſs, of which we ſpak already, alſo with ſuch as refreſh the part that is too empty, and ſuch as glew diſſolved unity, of which afterwards.</p>
               <p>Rarity, or the opening of the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible paſſages which Men cal Poroſities, which in great Joy poured forth, and Diaphoretical ſweatings, is often the cauſe of death, it is cured by Coolers, Aſtringents, and Emplaſticks, or ſuch as draw up the pores.</p>
               <p>Such things as are moſt obvious to be applyed outwardly; are the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with cold water and ſo much the more if it be cooled with Snow, or Ice, or firſt altered with cold aſtringents, of which we will ſpeak afterwards.</p>
               <p>Anointing of the Body with Oyls that are actually cold, eſpecially of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:154333:120"/>unripe Olives, or altered with cold aſtringents, as Roſes, Quinces and the like,</p>
               <p>Alſo the coldeſt Ayr is beſt, that with the cold of the Ayr, the pores may be contracted.</p>
               <p>If theſe things Suffice not, lay on Burnt Gip with cold water, as a cruſt upon the Body.</p>
               <p>If Rarity poſſeſs the part, as when by reaſon of rarity of the yard, the ſpirits cannot be conteined in the hollow Nerve, to cauſe ſtrong erection, thoſe Aſtringents that ſhall be by and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded muſt be applyed to the place affected, eſpecially hot, becauſe ſo they ſtrengthen the more.</p>
               <p>For the Denſity or aſtriction of thoſe paſſages, if it proceed from any matter that is impacted, hot detergents are moſt convenient, and ſuch as attenuate, which ſhall be propounded to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way obſtructions that come from thick matter that is impacted.</p>
               <p>If it proceed from cold and drineſs, things that are moderately hot and that attenuate without drying are needful, of which there is notable uſe to diſpoſe
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:154333:121"/>the Body to neceſſary ſweating, and to make the Body tranſpirable, which is procured to drive away the internal corruptions of Feavers, and to take off all <hi>Cutaneous</hi> ſpots.</p>
               <p>Such are Baths of warm water, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of water and Oyl, or warm water, chiefly altered with Dill, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momel, Marſh-mallows, Roots of white Lillies, Lin-ſeed, the flowers of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Jaſmin, and wall-flowers, Boyled, till half be conſumed.</p>
               <p>Alſo Unction may be made with Oyl very hot, firſt rubbing the part ſoftly, or let the Body be gently rubbed with the Palm of the Hand, dipt in the ſame Oyl, or ſome Spiced white Wine, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one half of the Decoction of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Mallows, in common water, if there be a ſtrong Feaver preſent.</p>
               <p>Alſo the rubbing it ſelf with ſoft Cloths, taketh away the thickneſs of the Skin, and Cupping Glaſſes do it more effectually, with or without Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.</p>
               <p>Alſo for the Amplitude, or Laxity and Dilatations of the Cavities or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible paſſages, aſtringents are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:154333:121"/>which do ſo much the more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thicken them, as the paſſages are ſmaller.</p>
               <p>The matter of aſtringents is of very long extent; they may be reduced to three Ranks, where the choice of every one for uſe may be eaſely found.</p>
               <p>Some do but a little bind, the uſe whereof principally is to corroborate the parts, and they do bridle excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are not altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, yet by their quantity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, they may weaken the ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Some do moderately bind, which have a principal force to repel all Fluxes from the parts that receive them, and to ſtay all Fluxes that are hurtful.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome aſtringents do compact the parts that are looſened, and are to be uſed, when by the force of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, and vehemency of Evacuation, there is imminent danger; as it falls out moſt commonly when the matter that flowes is very thin, and comes through paſſages that are very much looſened with the continuance of the defluxion.</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:154333:122"/>
               <p>In a cold cauſe let ſuch Remedies be made choice of, that bind with heat, or without any manifeſt coldneſs.</p>
               <p>But in a hot cauſe thoſe things will help which work by cooling.</p>
               <p>And of all kinds of aſtringents, theſe will be moſt eaſely provided for ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Remedies.</p>
               <p>Upon a cold cauſe theſe bind a little; all kinds of Wormwood, but eſpecially Sea Wormwood, Egrimony, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Coleworts wel Boyled, Coriander Seed, Cummin Seed torrefied, the Root of long Engliſh Galingal, the Hulls of Beans, Maſtich wood; and Leaves, Garden Mints dried, Maſtick, Rice dried, Roſemary, Sage, common Scabious, Frankinſence, Roſin of the Larch-Tree or Firr-Tree Boyled hard, ſharp Wine, or any other Wine ſteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

               <p>Streightneſs and Cloſeneſs of the Paſſages comes to paſs five waies: by obſtruction, conſtipation, Compreſſion, cleaving together, and by ſinking down: whence the differences of Diſeaſes in ſtreightneſs are taken; which, as they differ by generation, and variety of their cauſes, ſo are they taken away by diverſe Remedies.</p>
               <p>Obſtruction is properly called ſo, that ſtreightneſs of the Paſſages that comes from things that are contained within contrary to nature, not that are united and ſticking to the paſſages; ſuch are Vapours and Humors that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:154333:129"/>abound too much, or that are too thick and clammy, alſo corruption, Clotts of Blood, and Milk, Thorns, and little Bones that ſtay in the Throat and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſſage, Hares Stones, worms, dregs that ſtick to the Inteſtines.</p>
               <p>Corruption ſhut up in Impoſtumes, is taken away by opening the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume; which is done with Iron or actual fire, or by a potential Cautery; of which a little after.</p>
               <p>That which ſticks to Ulcers is taken away with Sarcoticks, of which we ſhall ſpeak in the cure of Ulcers.</p>
               <p>That which is poured forth into other Cavities, as into the ſharp Artery, is taken away with ſuch things as cut and cleanſe, Clots of Blood are to be diſſolved by Remedies that are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſet down and are to be evacuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by purging the Belly, alſo by Urin, Spittle, for the ſituation of the part affected, by Purgations and Diureticks, and expectorating Medicaments ſet down before.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſuch Remedies as diſſolve Clotted Milk and diſcuſs it, are evident by thoſe things that have been ſaid.</p>

               <p>Things that ſtick in the Gullet, if they can be ſeen, let them be drawn out with Iron Inſtruments; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the leaſt from their place, by Sternutation, Coughing, or vomit provoked by putting in the Finger, or a Feather into the Throat; alſo by drinking plentifully, or by ſwallowing down ſome ſolid Gobbet not much chewed and laſtly by ſwallowing down a ſpounge, firſt dipt in Rozin, that the thing may ſtick to it, and then drawn up again by a long thred tied to it.</p>
               <p>If Hairs and other things that come from without, appear, they muſt be taken out with Chirurgions Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if they be hid in the Stomach and Inteſtins, they are driven out by vomit or purging, as the ſick is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Concerning ſuch things as Purge the Belly, and drive out the excrements, and further concerning Remedies againſt ſtones and worms, and ſuch as diſcuſs abundant and groſs vapours, we ſpake, amongſt the Remedies that take away the cauſe of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Obſtruction from fullneſs, or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:154333:130"/>of Blood, is taken away by a thin diet, that is not of the beſt and much Juyce; by ſtrong exerciſe, and much rubbing, as by Medicaments that dry the whole Body; and by ſenſible Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, namely opening the Veins, Scarifications, Cupping with ſcarifying, Leeches.</p>
               <p>Bad Humors that are many, thick and clammy, by which frequently the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterium, the Liver, Spleen, Matrix, Reins, and Veins and arteries of other parts are ſtopped; require Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, firſt that are cutting, attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and cleanſing, laſtly Purging.</p>
               <p>Concerning Purging medicaments, we ſpake abundantly at the beginning; thoſe are of another kind, that are ſet down for to prepare groſs Humors, but becauſe theſe that unſtop the paſſages are of larger extent than ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Humors, and there is a very frequent uſe of them in the cure of Feavers, Hypochondriacal Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cure of the Spleen, Jaundice, the want of the Terms; it wil be worth our pains, to Reckon them up more diſtinctly, and to ſet them down in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:154333:131"/>three ranks, namely cold, temperate and hot, that ſo the choice of them may be the more eaſy.</p>
               <p>Cold Remedies that unſtop, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in the more acute Feavers, parts that are hot, and obſtructed by Humors thickned by aduſtion; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which the moſt Obvious are, Sorrel, Juyce of Citrons and Lemmons that are ſufficiently ripe, Succory, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive, Straw-berries, Roots of Graſs, Liver-wort, Hawkweed, the Roots of all the Docks, Seeds of Melons, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, Citruls, Cucumbers, gourds, Sow-Thiſtle, Garden Endive, Dandelion, four Trifoyl.</p>
               <p>Of theſe; are made Decoctions with water or Broth, for Syrups, which will be the better; if you add an Emulſion of the four great cold Seeds.</p>
               <p>Whey of Milk Clarified is effectual by it ſelf, but it is made moſt effectual by adding an Emulſion of the ſaid Seeds, or if it be altered with opening Herbs.</p>
               <p>The Clarified Juyce of Herbs is mingled with Broth for a preſent Syrup, to two or three ounces, the greateſt uſe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:154333:131"/>of the Juyce of Citrons or Lemmons is in meats and Medicaments, as alſo of the Emulſions of the Seeds of Melons and Gourds, as alſo thoſe more Liquid Panadoes, and Ptiſans of Barley, as they are commonly called.</p>
               <p>For ordinary drink, the Decoction of ſour Trifoyl is pleaſant enough, of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Straw-berries, and Graſs, which may be made more ſharp, adding a quantity of the Juyce of Citrons or Lemmons.</p>
               <p>But this is the thing that is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which ſour Roots perform, to deceive the ſick withall, that one ſtill calling for drink, that they make the water ſharp, and it may be made of the colour of Red Wine.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are moſt temperate, wherein there is no notable exceſs, of heat or cold that can be obſerved, are moſt convenient for Chronical Feavers, from the aduſtion of Humors, which is grown cold: alſo for Melancholick Doſeaſes, namely for Hypochondriacal Melancholy, and ſuch as are grown hard: amongſt ſimples, ſuch are, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Hair, Waters of ſour Mineralls,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:154333:132"/>Hops, Liquoris, Trichomanes, five Leave Graſs, all which are added to the Decoctions of the other cold Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
               <p>Many more Compounds may be made for every Mans deſire: for cold things mingled with thoſe that are equally hot, in the ſame proportion, do make temperate.</p>
               <p>For this end, ſometime Clarified Whey is altered, with Egrimony, Roots of Aſarum, Dodder, with a little worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, than which, there is nothing more profitable for the affects and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Melancholy.</p>
               <p>The ſame way may be given the Juyce of Succory thickned with the Juyce of Agrimony, and a little prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſteel, to be taken in Bolus before any opening Decoction.</p>
               <p>Alſo Honey and Sugar added to the Juyces and opening Decoctions of cold things, make temperate Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe eſpecially two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Syrups do ſerve, that are eaſy to be prepared, namely Oxymel Simplex, &amp; ſimple Syrup of vineger, which conſiſt of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:154333:132"/>one part of Vineger, two parts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or Sugar, and one fourth part of water.</p>
               <p>But the three following Remedies of this rank are the beſt, and eaſy to be made.</p>
               <p>Firſt Smiths Water Clarified for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary drink; with Water is made a weaker Mulſum, adding half as much of Honey or Sugar.</p>
               <p>The ſecond: one ſcruple of Cremor Tartar to one dram, added to opening Broths.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: prepared ſteel, without which, Schirrous hardneſs, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate obſtructions will hardly be Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The uſe of theſe is manifold, and ſo is the preparation: the moſt eaſy, and the ſooneſt made, and the beſt, is this.</p>
               <p>Let ſteel be beaten into thin and long Rods, or little Plates: for by putting to them a roul of Brimſtone they will melt, and fall into the Water that is put under them, and then they muſt be ground into a moſt fine Pouder; this Pouder is given from half a ſcruple to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:154333:133"/>two ſcruples or thereabouts, either in Bolus, Electuary or Wine.</p>
               <p>The faſhion of a Bolus is this.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Juyce of Egrimony, Borrage thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of each one ounce, Steel prepared two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> Make them for two Boluſes, to be taken a little before an opening De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
               <p>The Electuary is thus.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the Pouder of Egrimony, Maiden-Hair, Stone-fern, Harts Tongue, Roots of Cinkfoyl, Eiquoris, ſteel prepared, Leaves of Senna, of each one ounce, Cinnamon one dram &amp; an half, the pulp of Rayſins Boyled in white Wine, and pulped through a Hair Sive, one pound, Syrup of Apples only,</hi> or for the Poor, <hi>Oxymel ſimple, two pound.</hi> Mingle them for an Electuary according to art, to be taken to about one ounce, four hours before Dinner.</p>
               <p>It is given in Wine two waies, either drinking the fine Pouder of ſteel ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Wine, or preparing ſteeled Wine.</p>
               <p>This will be an excellent Pouder for one Doſe.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>prepared ſteel and Cremor Tartar of each one ſcruple, Cinnamon half a ſcruple.</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:154333:133"/>Mingle them for a Pouder.</p>
               <p>Steeled Wine will be made, if in four pound of Fragrant white Wine; you put in ſteel prepared and Leaves of Senna, of each one ounce, Cinnamon two drams, opening Herbs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the part obſtructed, three hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls, let them ſtand eight daies in a hot place, and ſtirr them often; ſtrain them for your uſe, and give two or three ounces to drink; alſo a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſteeled Syrup may be prepared after this faſhion.</p>
               <p>Take prepared ſteel ſo much as you pleaſe, pour upon it the ſharpeſt vineger, that it may ſwim above it four Fingers breadth, &amp; let it ſtand in a hot place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it hath drawn out the tincture of the ſteel: then by inclining the Veſſel, pour it from the grounds: and to this Sugar, or Honey Clarified, the double propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; moreover half an ounce of Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, and one pugil of the tops of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to every pound of Vineger, Boyl them at a genle fire to the conſiſtence of a Syrup, then ſtrain them, the Doſe is one ounce, with a Deeoction that is proper for the part affected.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:154333:134"/>
               <p>Thoſe things that are applyed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly muſt be mingled of ſoftners and diſcuſſers; ſuch are the Fomentations of the Decoction of Mallows, Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, Melilot, Foenugreek, Dill, Chamomel, and a quantity of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, to Corroborate the part; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about the end of the Decoction, ſome white Wine, and Vineger to help the Penetration.</p>
               <p>After the Fomentation; make an Oyntment of Oyl prepared by Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of things aforeſaid, ſuch as is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed amonſt thoſe that ſoften hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The hotter things that unſtop, are convenient for a cold temper, and a cold time, as alſo for long Agues; ſuch are theſe common ſimples: wormwood, Egrimony, Smallage, Mugwort, Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus, Betony, chiefly the Root of Capers, the Rind, Stone-fern, German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Dodder, common wild Carrot Seed, Root of Elecampane, Fennel, Rind of Aſh, Fumitory, the common and the Yellow, Root of Gentian, Harts-Tongue, Fetherfew, white Horehound, or wild Mints, Parſley, Penniroyal,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:154333:134"/>Madder, Knee-Holm, Tamariſk, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, in the uſe whereof, thoſe muſt alwaies be choſen, that are proper for the parts affected, and are propounded amongſt the alteratives.</p>
               <p>Alſo Syrups and Electuaries and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are made of thoſe things we have ſpoken of, as the occaſion ſhall be.</p>
               <p>The Decoctions are made the more effectual in the Broth of an old Cock or Pidgeon, if you can procure it.</p>
               <p>Alſo Phyſick Wines are ſuppoſed to be beſt, as wormwood Wine, when the weakneſs of the Bowels is of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; and of theſe Wines, adding half the quantity of Clarified Honey, are made Syrups that are profitable and pleaſing; but the Wines are made moſt effectual, adding ſteel to them, as we ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>A ſomething ful Mulſum will be the beſt to drink, if it be altered with the Herbs propounded: as alſo al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Oxymels made with the ſame for a Syrup, ſuch as is the ordinary Syrup of the Apothecaries, made with the five opening Roots, Smallage,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:154333:135"/>Aſparagus, Fennel, Parlley, Butchers Broom.</p>
               <p>Alſo the uſe of Vineger of Squils is extolled, added to Syrups and Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to half a Spoonful.</p>
               <p>Some there are that prefer before all theſe, the uſe of the Root of Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowpint, often infuſed in Wine, and ſtil dryed again, til it hath loſt almoſt al its Tartneſs.</p>
               <p>It may be alſo added to Electuaries, but the fine Pouder of it is oftner uſed, given with Wine or Broth. The faſhion of it may be Thus.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>preparedſteel and Wake-Robin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, of each half an ounce, Cinnamon one dram and an half, Fennel Seed half a dram, fine Sugar one ounce.</hi> Mingle them.</p>

               <p>Fleſh and a Callous, as they are not hard to be taken away with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Iron, when they may be ſeen, ſo they are taken away only with Phyſicks, and that with much more difficulty, when they are hid within the Body: and ſince Fleſh is ſofter than a Callous is, it requireth more mild Remedies that either dry ſtrongly, or heat very gently; but a Callous requries, either Corroders, or ſuch as putrefie.</p>
               <p>Therefore for fleſh theſe are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, round Ariſtolochia Roots, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony Calcined, Roots of Black Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore, burnt Allum, burnt Galls, the Aſhes of burnt Honey, common Red Lead, Aſhes of Roots of Gentian, Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Shells, eſpecially ſuch as are burnt,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:154333:136"/>Lead Calcined with Brimſtone, the Aſhes of burnt Spunges; the Pouders of all theſe are mingled with Unguents, or infuſed in Liquors.</p>
               <p>The following Oyntment is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for excreſcences of fleſh; but firſt of all, it takes away little fleſh in the urinary paſſages, and that without pain, if it be put on the end of a Candle, for it ſticks very faſt, and doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriate the parts that are ſound.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Honey burnt to Aſhes, prepared Tutty, freſh butter waſhed, waſhed Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Yellow Wax, of each half an ounce; burnt Allum half a dram.</hi> Mingle them and make a Liniment according to Art.</p>
               <p>This Pouder alſo is excellent deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Mercatus, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de recto Praeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dior. uſu. Cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Verdigreaſe, Auripigment, Vitriol and Roch-Allum, of each equal parts.</hi> Bray them with the ſharpeſt Vineger, and make them into fine Pouder, and ſet them in the Sun in the dog daies; the Pouder being dried, muſt again be made fine with Vineger poured on, and put into the Sun the ſecond time, and this muſt be done for the ſpace of ten daies; then:</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:154333:137"/>
               <p>Take <hi>Litharge of Gold, poudered and ſifted, one part: Oyl of Roſes two parts.</hi> Boyl them to the conſiſtence of a Plaiſter; take an equal part of this, and mingle with the ſaid Pouder for your uſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo this Pouder takes away all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences, by Certain proof.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the Shells of Walnuts, Spunges, Roots of round Ariſtolochia, of each equal parts.</hi> Let them be dried together in a Pot put into an Oven, that they may be beaten into Pouder; and with this Pouder ſtrew over the part affected, firſt anointed with Honey.</p>
               <p>Theſe take away Callous matter, amongſt the moſt common Remedies, Orpiment, Spaniſh Green, Quick-Lime, Lees of Wine burnt, Lees of Vineger burnt, burnt Vitriol, Oyl of Brimſtone and Vitriol. All theſe things in uſe, are tempered with milder Remedies, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in greater, ſome times in leſſer quantity, as need requires.</p>
               <p>An Example of them in Infuſion.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the Decoction of round Ariſtolochia, Black Hellebore, Marſh-mallow Roots, half a pound, Oyl of Brimſtone or Vitriol half a ſcruple.</hi> Mingle it for an Infuſion.</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:154333:137"/>
               <p>For an Uncrion:</p>
               <p>Take <hi>burnt Vitriol, and Allum burnt, of each one dram: freſh Butter very wel waſhed half an ounce.</hi> Mingle them.</p>
               <p>If you add the Pouder of white Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Seed, or Henbane, you make a Remedy wholly without Pain.</p>
               <p>The Pouder of <hi>Mereatus</hi> uſed by it ſelf is moſt effectual.</p>
               <p>This is exceeding good that is more eaſy to provide. Work Quick-Lime with Honey, like a paſt, and dry it in an Oven, that it may be beaten to Pouder, to be ſtrewed upon any Callous or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Fleſh, firſt anointed with Honey.</p>

               <p>Violent Aſtriction, follows moſt commonly outward cauſes: as bands bound too faſt, which muſt be untied.</p>
               <p>Growing together of the paſſages, is made by a mutual Glewing together of the ſides, when Nature fills up the wounds of them by the coming of good Blood thither; and this is cured only by an inciſion Knife, or Iron Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can part the ſides that are Glewed: but after ſeperation, the ſides muſt be well fenced, that they may neither touch one the other, or grow together again; therefore the growing together of the inward parts is incurable becauſe they cannot be cut.</p>
               <p>The ſinking down of the Cavity, if it fal out by reaſon of Evacuation of the matter that ſhould be contained within it, it is cured by Nutriment only to re-generate neceſſary matter.</p>

               <p>When the ſuperficies is too plain it is taken away with Remedies that ſcour, and then with driers.</p>
               <p>Things that ſcour, are all ſuch that were propounded for to prepare Flegm.</p>
               <p>To take away obſtruction, by the ſtuffing in of groſs and Clammy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and to ſcour the Skin, natural Salt waters have a kind of prerogative, and artificial waters alſo, and Honey added to Decoctions which are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally made of bitter things, as the Roots of Gentian, Elecampane, long Ariſtolochia, and Centory the leſs.</p>
               <p>For drying, things that Evacuate inſenſibly are moſt fit, being mingled with the ſtrongeſt aſtringents, of which before.</p>

               <p>Natural Magnitude, is made faulty, either by exceſs or defect, when it is augmented beyond its proportion, or elſ diminiſhed. The kinds of Magnitude
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:154333:139"/>diminiſhed, are reckoned to be, Defect of Nouriſhment, or Leanneſs of all the parts, and Maraſmus, or a Conſumption of the whole Body, following a Hectick Feaver, or waſting away; for Leanneſs of thoſe that recover after ſharp Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſcarſe deſerves the name of a Diſeaſe, becauſe it quickly goes away, ſo ſoon as the Diſeaſe on which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, is removed.</p>
               <p>Of Magnitude increaſed, which men call Tumors, all the differences are taken from the cauſe, which in general is four fold.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a ſolid Body according to ſubſtance, belonging to the ſoundneſs of the Body, whence come groſſneſs, from overmuch fat; <hi>Hyperſarcoſis,</hi> from ſome excreſcence of fleſh, Ruptures of the Bowels, and the Caul, when the Guts or the Caul fal down, which alſo makes a Diſeaſe in ſcituation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a Humor, or ſome thing like to a Humor, whence comes that they call <hi>Phlegm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third is, that which comes Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally from the Humors, as puffing up from wind.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that which growes in the whole kind Preternaturally, from a various and unſpeakable corruption of the Humors, whence comes properly an Impoſtume, or little Swelling with a little Bag, namely Meliceris, from a matter like to Honey, <hi>Steatoma,</hi> from a fat matter like to Sewet, and <hi>Athero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> from a matter like to Gruel.</p>
               <p>A particular Conſumption, ſuch as falls upon thoſe parts that are held with a Palſie and Convulſions, requires firſt ſuch Remedies as can Purge out the foulneſs of the Body by the paſſages convenient: then Nouriſhments that can make good Blood; laſtly attractives that draw Blood to the part, and can ſtirr up the heat of it and ſtrengthen it.</p>
               <p>Gentle rubbings til the part wax red,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:154333:140"/>and Swel a little, will perform all theſe.</p>

               <p>Laſt of all, the moſt prevalent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is pication, til the part wax red and ſwell: and theſe things are to be done, after concoction, before any more meat be eaten.</p>
               <p>In a Conſumption of the Eyes, there remains no place for pications or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings, but only, for Fomentations; the beſt whereof are made with Milk a little Saffron, or of the ſame Boyled with Mallows, Violets, Marſh-mallows, and Fennel, or with a ſweet Apple, brought to the form of a ſoft Cataplaſm, with a little Saffron.</p>
               <p>A hot <hi>Maraſmus</hi> without a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is curable, is chiefly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the uſe of Milk and Baths:

               <p>Take <hi>Barley Meal ſix parts, fine Sugar one part.</hi> Place them bed upon bed in a Glaſed Earthen Pot, and the firſt and laſt bed muſt be Sugar: then making a Cover of Paſt, put it into the Oven after the Bread is drawn forth.

               <p>But for an Ulcer of the Lungs in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular this is commended. Take one dram of the Pouder of Yarrow, dayly in Broth or ſome convenient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
               <p>Alſo a Cake of dried Folefoot taken dayly made with Butter and Sewet of a Hog.</p>

               <p>Alſo the Seed of Ameos, or the Seed that is in Elder berries can do as much, taken to half a dram, drank in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Aſh.</p>

But in people that are of years, if it be Old, it is held hitherto by Phyſitians to be incurable, without Chirurgery: yet uſe, that is the beſt maſter of things, and Judg of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, hath taught us not long ſince; that the Ruptures of men of years, and that very great ones, and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, have grown together by the uſe of Medicaments only, and a convenient courſe of diet, and that within three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore daies at the longeſt, in manly and in Old Age; but in forty daies in Yong men, and at mans ſtature; by the help of which Remedies, Boys are cured within twenty daies: unleſs the falling of the Inteſtins into the Cods be very great, and all moſt grown Habitual.</p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:154333:143"/>

               <p>The firſt is this: Take one dram of the Herb Two-blade, in half a Cup of red Wine, Boyled with the Leaves of the ſame Plant, every morning five hours before dinner. And let the place affected, be dayly anoynted with Oyl of four Olives, wherein a whole land Hedg-Hog that is Old, hath been Boyled, with his Skin and al, til the fleſh be conſumed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond. Take for threeſcore daies one Cup of ſtrong red Wine, altered with one ounce, of Rupture-wort (the whole Herb with the Roots muſt be taken, and the tendreſt can be got) firſt bruiſed, and during the ſaid time, a Spunge muſt be laid to the place affected; that is firſt dipped into the ſame red Wine, and then preſſed out.</p>
               <p>The third. Take one dram of Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of equal portions, of Rupture wort,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:154333:143"/>Wall-Rue and Aſparagus and Horſe-Tail, in half a Cup of ſtrong Red Wine, for the time ſpoken of before; and let the place be anointed twice every day, with common Oyl or Oyl of St. Johns-wort, wherein live Lizards, by long ſtanding of it in the Sun, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
               <p>The fourth. Let a Cerate be laid on, made of equal parts of Bdellium and poudered Aloes with the white of an Egg; and the ſame time let the ſick take one dram of the Pouder following in half a Cup of the beſt Red Wine, five hours before Dinner.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Roots of great Comfrey, Herb Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, common Hedg-Hyſop, the leſs, Two-Blade, Horſe-Tayl, Coriander prepared, Juyce of Roſes, ſteel prepared with Roſe water, of each one ounce and an half.</hi> Mingle them, and make a fine Pouder of them all.</p>
               <p>The preparing of the ſteel is this. That the filings of Steel or Iron, be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Roſe Water, and then dryed in the ſhade, and then again be ſet on fire, and quenched a-freſh in the ſame Water, until it can be poudered very fine.</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:154333:144"/>
               <p>But in the uſe of theſe Medicaments, this rule is generally to be obſerved: that a Truſs be conſtantly worn, and the ſick muſt take care he hold not his breath, nor uſe ſtrong exerciſe, nor eat or drink, meats or drinks that are windy.</p>
               <p>Remedies for Tumors that proceed from Humors, are manifeſt by what hath been ſaid, ſince they muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the taking away of the cauſe, which muſt be repulſed at the firſt: but in the augmentation, they muſt partly repel, and partly digeſt; in the ſtate, they muſt digeſt, or if it can be, bring to ſuppuration: but a Tumor that is very hard, muſt firſt be acurately ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then digeſted and diſſolved. Therefore ſome few things ſhall here be only annexed, that are found to be proved for ſome Tumors, and are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies eaſie to come by.</p>
               <p>For an Eriſipulas of any part whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>Take fine Wheat flower ſo much as you pleaſe, put it into a bag of thin Weaving, and lay it to the part, at any time of the Defluxion.</p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:154333:144"/>
               <p>For kibes that are Ulcerated: this is a moſt excellent Unguent.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Leaves of green Tobacco, the inward, Rind of the Elder, of each one handful, Roots of the Male Daffodil ſliced, one ounce, common Oyl one pound;</hi> Boyl all at a gentle fire, til all the moiſture be conſumed, then preſs all out ſtrongly, <hi>and add Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence finely poudered half an ounce, Yellow Wax ſix drams.</hi> Mingle them for a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and anoint the part affected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: then for Fingers that are pained, let it be rubbed ſtrongly on them til they grow very red and hot.</p>
               <p>This is alſo good for fowlneſs of the Skin and for Morphews.</p>

               <p>Remedies for Worms and Stones are to be found amongſt theſe things, which reſpect the cauſe from the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>For a Pin and Web, theſe amongſt Remedies eaſie to come by, are the moſt convenient, being applyed Warm to the Eye, but eſpecially by the help of an Ocular Cupping Glaſs; that the Remedy may work longer and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Herbs, Celondine, Fennel, Vervain Rue, of each one handful; Honey of Roſes half a pound, of Rape Roots bruiſed two ounces.</hi> Stamp the Herbs and ſet all mingled together in the Sun, and let them be ſtirred daily; after forty daies preſs out the Juyce, to be kept for uſe in a Braſen Veſſel, and drop it into the Eye by it ſelf, or mingle it with more gentle Eye-Salves.</p>

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:154333:148"/>two chief kinds, an Ulcer, and a wound.</p>
               <p>That comes from an eating cauſe, and ſo muſt neceſſarily have joyned with it, loſs of ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>A wound, is all other kinds of diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unity, without an eating cauſe; whether it be a ſimple ſolution of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or with loſs of ſubſtance, as in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound wound.</p>
               <p>And though for the diverſity of parts, often times all theſe things are changed (for an Ulcer in the bone is called rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs, a wound fracture, when the Nerves are brok, it is called convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when they are pricked, Puncture, and when the fleſh is bruiſed, men call it contuſion) yet ſtil they hold the ſame nature, ſo they differ not in generation; for whatſoever Ulcer proceeds from a ſharp and corroding matter, ſuch as are the Humors, and ſharp Bloody mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, harſh Poyſons, and Medicaments that are putrefactive, and cauſticks, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fire, corruption, moiſture, into which the ſubſtance corrupted is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, as in a Gangrene: al other cauſes that diſſolve the continnity, by cutting,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:154333:148"/>breaking, Knocking, Contuſion, they make a wound only taken in a large ſence.</p>
               <p>A ſimple wound, or ſolution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity without loſs of ſubſtance; is cured by Glutinative Medicaments, which by drying, Binding, Sticking, force the lips of the wound together, and bind them faſt: which Union can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made immediately in the Bones, becauſe of their hardneſs, but it is made by the means of a Callous, the matter whereof, glewing nouriſhments afford.</p>
               <p>But fractures are faſtened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ſame glewing Remedies, of which there are two ranks, ſuch as are moderate, and ſuch as are forcible: thoſe belong to a aprt and conſtitution that are moiſt, theſe belong to parts &amp; conſtitutions that are more dry, and to a Bloody wound.</p>
               <p>Moderate Glutinatives; the moſt Obvious are: the white of an Egg, St. Peters-wort, Tutſane, Yarrow, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards-purſe, the fruit of Creeping-Balſam, new Cheeſe, and Glew made of it, Horſe-Tail, Herb Bennet, Ciſtus,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:154333:149"/>Flower of the Sun, the Graſs <hi>Iſchaemon,</hi> Plum-Tree Gum, ground Ivy. The Herb <hi>Siciliana,</hi> Herb Trinity, St Johns-wort, Adders Tongue, Yarrow, Leaves of Medlars, <hi>Ophris,</hi> Plantain, wild Pears, Damaſk Roſes, the Bramble, the Male Sanicle, Germander, Scabious, Veronica, Golden-Rod, Leaves of Elms</p>
               <p>Of theſe, may be made vulnerary drinks: alſo they may be given inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in other forms.</p>
               <p>They are laid on outwardly either bruiſed, or ſtrewed on in Pouders, or preſſed out and dropped in, or Boyled, chiefly in ſharp Red Wine, and their operation is helped by Ligature, by which the Lips of the wound united are held together.</p>
               <p>There are ſome other things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wounds that are ſimple and new, are preſently joyned together, applyed by themſelves &amp; bound on; namely Roſin of the Larch or the Firr-Tree, Pellitory of the Wall bruiſed the bruiſed Leaves of Tobacco, dry Pitch, ſpotted Arſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart, beaten Oyl made by inſolation, or the Leaves of Adders Tongue, or
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:154333:149"/>the fruit of the Balſam Apple.</p>
               <p>But the chief of all, and like to a weſt Indian Balſam, (than which to knit wounds together, there is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is the Oyl that is drawn out of the flowers of St. Johns-wort, ſhut into a Glaſs, and made by heat of the Sun beams, by deſcent. Alſo Earth Worms waſhed in Black Wine and beaten, are good: alſo amongſt eaſie to be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be ſet down that they call <hi>Oleum Hiſpanum,</hi> deſcribed in the five Books of Chirurgery of <hi>Aquapendente;</hi> by which in twenty four hours time, wounds are ſaid to be healed.</p>
               <p>Theſe Glew together Violently; Lions-Foot, the flowers of flower-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, middle Comfrey, the leſs Comfrey, unripe Galls, all the Cranes Bills, but chiefly Pidgeons Foot, Hypociſtis, Hares-Foot, Rinds of Pomegranates, Leaves of the Olive, chiefly the wood Olive Tree, Mouſe-ear, Knot-Graſs, Juyce of Sloes, the tender Leaves of Oaks, Stone-Comfrey of Lobelius, Dog-berry Tree.</p>
               <p>The way of diſpenſing of all theſe is the ſame with the former.</p>

               <p>Outwardly, the flew of a hare burnt, Aſſes dung, burnt Spunges, and brought to Pouder, and Honey Suckles uſed what way ſoever.</p>
               <p>But if the part be only contuſed, without any ſenſible ſolution: corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratives are convenient, mixt with digeſters and anodines: of this kind is Lead beaten with Wormwood, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood heated on a Tile and ſprinkled with Vineger, bean Meal with ſweet Wine made into the form of a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm; alſo Flower of Wheat together, with Black Wine, Pouder of Roſes, Wormwood and Oyl of Roſes for a Cataplaſm.</p>
               <p>Arſmart bruiſed and ſprinkled with hot Wine, Fomentations of hot Water, eſpecially Sea water altered with Wormwood.</p>
               <p>Moreover this Liniment is the beſt of all to heal all contuſions, which wonderfully alſo aſſwageth the pain of the Swoln Hemroids, and takes away the pain of the Teeth, being ſoftly rubbed on the Gums.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>common Oyl one pound, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of an Ox Leg, Yellow Wax, Boſin of the</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:154333:150"/>Firr-Tree, or Pitch (vulgarly called Roſe,) of each three ounces: freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four ounces.</p>
               <p>Let them all melt at a ſoft fire, and when the Marrow is melted take them off.</p>
               <p>An Ulcer is either ſuperficial, or deeper.</p>
               <p>That is, either actually ſo, when the top of the Skin is wanting, as the fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in Children; or is potential, that by the force of an external cauſe quickly comes to be ſo, unleſs it be hindered, as is burning, which if it be preſently helped there followeth no Ulcer.</p>
               <p>A ſuperficial Ulcer is cured with the more mild inducers of a Cicatrize: burnings are cured with the ſame when the Bladders are broken.</p>
               <p>But you may keep the part unhurt, if you lay on theſe things that follow, in time: namely writing Ink, Liquid Verniſh applyed with a very ſoft cloth: a whol Egg with Oyl of Roſes, or ſtirred together by it ſelf; Oyl made by Decoction of the middle Rind of Elders; white of an Egg very well beaten with Vineger, adding a littie raw Allum to it.</p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:154333:151"/>
               <p>Theſe two following Uuguents are the moſt excellent; with the former, of which the parts being anointed, you may handle fire without any harm.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the Juyce preſſed out of the Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, Roots, and all, ſix ounces: Oyl of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der four ounces, Crude Roch Allum one ounce.</hi> Boyl them at a gentle fire to a mean conſiſtence, add <hi>new Wax one ounce and an half,</hi> mingle them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond. Take <hi>common Oyl, three ounces, new Wax one ounce and an half, Yolks of Eggs roſted under the Aſhes, in number two.</hi> Diſſolve them and mingle them, til they become like an Unguent, ſpread it on a Cloth, and renew it twice a day.</p>
               <p>Alſo an Unguent of Iſing-Glaſs is much commended, and of Allum <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beum,</hi> mingled with Vineger in equal quantities.</p>
               <p>Alſo Juyce of Marſh mallows wrought with the white of an Egg.</p>
               <p>A deep wound muſt firſt be filled with fleſh, with Remedies called Sarcoticks, which do ſcowr away the thick excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the part, and conſume the thin; then we muſt bring it to Cicatrize with
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:154333:151"/>Epuloticks, which by their great drying, do not only conſume the excrements, but the Blood alſo, and do harden the upper Superficies of the Ulcer, and do as it were turn it into Skin.</p>
               <p>Sarcoticks, or Remedies that fil up the Ulcer, are as large, as there be differences of hollow Ulcers.</p>
               <p>For an Ulcer that is very moiſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Remedies that are very great driers, ſo that ſuch Remedies as are convenient to Skin a plain Ulcer, are neceſſary to fil a hollow Ulcer that is over-moiſt, but an Ulcer that is very foul requires ſtrong cleanſers.</p>
               <p>But this is principally to be obſerved, that aſtringents be not mingled with great driers and ſcourers, for they will faſten the excrement to the Ulcer, and ſo make it more deep and ſpreading.</p>
               <p>Therfore there may be ſet two degrees of Sarcoticks; the mean, that belong to a ſoft part, and to an Ulcer that is not over-moiſt and foul: And the Violent, which agree to a drier part, and are fit for an Ulcer, that is very moiſt and foul.</p>
               <p>Moreover there is no hopes to fil up an Ulcer by the help of Sarcoticks,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:154333:152"/>unleſs thoſe Impediments be firſt taken away, which hinder the Regeneration of the ſubſtance that was loſt, as the Flux of any matter, that is ptenan in overmuch plenty, or ill quality, the diſtemper of the Ulcerated part, a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous bred in the Ulcer, or Rottenneſs of the Bone, corruption or deſtemper.</p>
               <p>Theſe things take away the Flux, namely ſuch as evacuate; make revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, repel, intercept, contemperate, and corroborate the parts affected, by the faultineſs whereof the excrements are renewed, of which we ſpake before in the Remedies of the cauſes, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the ſimilary parts.</p>
               <p>The dictemper of the ulcerated part, is corrected by contraries, of which we ſpake alſo: but in a Gangreen there is ſo great Humidity of the part and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the inbred heat, that there is need of an actual or a Potential fire; but of the two, the firſt works quicker, and ſtrengthens the part more.</p>
               <p>For a Gangrene in beginning, or where there is danger thereof, as in great blows from great Guns, there is nothing better than the following Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:154333:152"/>if Lint be dipt into it and laid to the wound, with which alſo all foul Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, if there be malignity in them, are happily cured.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>flowers of Brimſtone three ounces, complete Oyl of Roſes half a pound, the beſt Red Wine four ounces.</hi> Let them infuſe for eight daies at a gentle fire, alwaies ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it til the Wine be conſumed, then ſtrain it, and diſſolve therein two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the beſt Turpentine. Mingle them, and keep it for your uſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo for Ulcers that proceed from thin Choller, as ſmal Bliſters, or ſuch as eat not deep, and for an Ulcerate Eriſipelex, when the Humidity of the part Joyned with Acrimony cauſeth great trouble in the cure; the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unguent of Elders profits excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, for with it not only Ulcers of the ſimilary parts, but burnings of al kinds, and almoſt al foulneſs of the Skin are cured.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>common Salt and the beſt Red Wine of each three ounces, diſſolve the Salt in the Wine, then add of the middle Rind of the Elder half a pound,</hi> infuſe them for two hours, then add <hi>compleat Oyl of Roſes one
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:154333:153"/>pound and an half.</hi> Boyl al at a gentle fire, til the moiſture be almoſt conſumed: then to the reſidue of the rind add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>compound Oyl of Roſes half a pound, Salt diſſolved in Wine as before, half an ounce.</hi> Boyl them ſtrongly til al the moiſture be conſumed, that the rind become dry and crumble, with this Oyl diligently preſled out, Boyl Litharge of Gold prepared and ſifted two ounces, to which being exactly. Boyled, add the foreſaid Oyl, and let them Wax hot, laſt of all put in the following ingredients pulped through a Hair five together, namely, <hi>of the beſt Ceruſs one ounce, Lead burnt with Brimſtone and not waſhed ſeven ounces and an half, Yellow Wax what is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Callous is taken off moſt ſafely with a pair of Nippers, or with actual fire where it may be done; if it cannot, then it may be taken on with corroding Remedies, deſcribed amongſt the means of thickning the Cavity: by the reaſon of this Impediment there do often remain incurable Fiſtulaes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cut, nor handled fitly every way by occeſſary Medicaments; for theſe the

               <p>It is thus eaſily prepared.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Cranes Bill, or Pidgeons Foot cut, two ounces, Root of Flower de Luce very well waſhed three drams, Root of Black Hellebore prepared two drams, Wheat Corns one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, bruiſe them groſſely,</hi> and infuſe them for one day, in one pound of ſharp Red Wine; then add <hi>Oyl of St. Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort and Mirtills of each three ounces.</hi> Let them Boyl at a gentle fire til the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture be conſumed: make expreſſion and ſtrain them, then add <hi>Bitumen, and Mirrh of each one dram and an half,</hi> Let them ſtand at a ſoft heat til they be perfectly melted, then add <hi>of Roſin of the Larch Tree and Firr Tree,</hi> (and if you can get it of occidental Balſam) <hi>of each one ounce.</hi> Mingle them at an eaſie fire and make a Balſom to be dropt into a Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, and to be put in with Tents.</p>
               <p>To take away Spungy Fleſh that abounds in an Ulcer, uſe the Remedies deſcribed for a Diſeaſe in conſtipation by Fleſh and a Callous.</p>
               <p>Yet to theſe add the following
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:154333:154"/>Pouder to make an Eſcar, whereby Malignant Ulcers (as Malignant Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalous matter, and ulcerated Cancers) if they be ſmal, and new are happily cured.</p>
               <p>Take the Root of great Serpentine, gathered in <hi>June,</hi> and cut in pieces and dried in the ſhade, and of white Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick of each one ounce, Pouder them, and mingle them, and ſet them in the Sun til the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> in a great Bellied Glaſs well ſtopt, and ſhake them often, then keep the Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for this uſe: namely waſh the Ulcer often, and foment it with a wet Linnen Cloth with Water of Water Lillies, or the Decoction of the ſame; the next day after ſtrew on the Pouder, making a defenſative, for the ſame parts with ſome Cerate, leaſt the Pouder ſpread further than it ſhould, the eſcar will fal out of its own accord in twelve daies, and the cure muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with the ſtrongeſt Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>The Bone that is under the Ulcer being bare, muſt be corroborated by the ſtrowing on of Pouders, that Fleſh may grow upon it.</p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:154333:154"/>
               <p>And theſe are made of equal parts of the Root of Dog Fennel, round Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochia Flower-de-Luce, Mirrh and Frankinſence.</p>
               <p>And if it have already contracted any Blackneſs, there is need of an Iron to ſcrape it off, and of actual fire; then the Pouder muſt be ſtrewed on.</p>
               <p>If the Bone be Rotten, it muſt be taken away by Inſtruments of Iron and an actual Cautory.</p>
               <p>Yet ſomtimes it fals out by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the Ulcer, and the windings in it, that the Bone under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath cannot be touched by Iron Inſtruments, or fire, and can hardly be perceived by the probe, in which caſe ſome ſharp and drying Remedy muſt be poured in for ſome daies that the rottenneſs may be taken away: of this ſort eaſie to prepare, are the Decoctions of Ariſtolochia, gentian, Wake-Robin, poured upon Calcined Tartar ſhut up in a Bag.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Tartar is more labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous which is chiefly commended for this purpoſe, if it be tempered with ſome convenient Liquor. The impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:154333:155"/>being taken away, the uſe of Sarcoticks wil be afterwards profitable, or of ſuch as fil up the Ulcer, a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue whereof now followeth.</p>
               <p>For an Ulcer that is not over moiſt and foul, and for a part that is very ſoft; mean Sarcoticks are convenient; namely Salt and Nitrons Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Betony, Gentian Root, Mints, flower-de-Luce, Honey ſuckles, Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Honey, the Clot-Burr, al kind of Roſins, Scordium, Wheat, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>Of Herbs, Decoctions may be made, for waſhings and infuſion; alſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents may be made ſuddenly, making Oyl firſt by Decoction, then adding a quantity of Wax, &amp; if you pleaſe ſome Honey alſo and Roſin, or Pouders, which are eſpecially provided of Roots and Frankinſence.</p>
               <p>Alſo a ſimple Pouder of Herbs may be ſirewed upon the Ulcer.</p>
               <p>For outward Remedies, add Tobacco and the Leſſer Centory.</p>
               <p>The form of an outward Unguent may be of this kind.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Betony one handful,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:154333:155"/>Tobacco half a handful, common Oyl four ounces.</hi> Cut the Herbs and Boyl them in Oyl, til al the moiſture be conſumed: then add common Roſin one ounce, new Wax half an ounce, Pouder of the Root of Flower-de-Luce or Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence two drams, mingle them and make an Unguent.</p>
               <p>The more forcible, and ſuch as are proper for a ſordid Ulcer, and a part that is more hard, theſe are convenient: round Ariſtolochia Roots, good Henry, <hi>Colus Jovis,</hi> Horehound, Raw Honey, Mirrh, Root of Dog Fennel.</p>
               <p>In outward Remedies, Chimney Soot, Blacking of Pitch, Lime very wel waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, dry Pitch, Liquid Pitch mingled with Honey, the ſhels of Periwinkles, and the ſhels of al Sea Fiſh Burnt, and the Aſhes of all Sarcotick Herbs.</p>
               <p>Theſe may be made of divers forms, as in Liniments, Unguents, Pouders, Juyces and Decoctions.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Leaves of good Henry, and <hi>Colus Jovis</hi> lightly bruiſed, and laid on with the Back ſide, cure al Ulcers that are hard to be cured.</p>
               <p>To theſe belong the Balſam of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:154333:156"/>diſcribed, which wonderfully fils up hollow Ulcers; <hi>Rulandus</hi> makes an Unguent of it, that is very much commended for all rebellious Ulcers, As.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>the Balſam of Brimſtone three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, new Wax half an ounce, Colophonia three drams, Mirrh, the wait of them all.</hi> Let the Mirrh finely poudered be ſtrewed in by degrees to al the reſt when they are melted and wel mingled: and let them be Boyled at a ſoft fire, alwaies ſtirring them with a Spatula, until they are ſingular well mixt, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fals out in a quarter of an hour: then take it from the fire, and let them cool eaſily.</p>
               <p>Yet the Plaiſter of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> gives place neither to this Remedy nor to any other, and it is eaſie to be provided, whereby Old, rotten, ſtinking Ulcers, that are very hollow and foul are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully cured, and it may be laid to all hollow Ulcers, if for Ulcers that are troubled with a ſharp Defluxion, and very tender, it be tempered with the Unguent of Elder diſcribed before for St. Anthonies fire, adding a greater or
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:154333:156"/>leſſer quantity, as the ſence of the part is more quick, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of regenerating Fleſh be more or leſs.</p>
               <p>The Plaiſter is this.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>ten Yolks of Eggs, clear Turpentine half a pound.</hi> Mingle them with a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Spatula to an oinment, in the ſame Veſſel they muſt be Boyled, and this wil be done in half a quarter of an hour, then add Honey to the weight of them al, ſtirr them ſtrongly and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they clotter not: then Boyl them at an eaſie Coal fire, moving them conſtantly, then increaſing the fire, til they become of a browniſh dark colour, more like to Black, then Yellow or Reddiſh.</p>
               <p>An Ulcer and a wound, that is filled up to make an equal ſuperficies with the ſound part, is healed with Epulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or ſuch as cauſe it to Cicatrize, whereof ſome are milder, and more convenient for ſoft parts, ſome are for parts and conſtitutions that are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The more violent, ſhould they be
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:154333:157"/>made uſe of in a ſoft part they will make a Cicatrize but ſo hard and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that it may hinder the motion of the Joynt.</p>
               <p>The meaner that are moſt Obvious are theſe: Potters Earth, or white Chalk, Horſe-Tail, the flowers of both Pomegranats, Ceruſs, Cotton burnt, the Aſhes of Lint, Pennywort, Scuttle Bone, burnt Spunge, flew of a Hare burnt, Root of Tormentil, al Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Earth, Litharge, and al cold things that are moderately aſtringent; alſo the cold Air of it ſelf wil make a Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize; dry forms work more ſtrongly than the moiſt do, therefore Pouders applyed with Lint are good.</p>
               <p>But to avoid the inequality of a Cicatrize and hardners in a conſpicuous part, it ſufficeth to uſe Liniments or Unguents.</p>
               <p>The moſt excellent is the Unguent of Elder already propounded againſt Herpes or the Wolf.</p>
               <p>Other Remedies may ſuddenly be provided of Ceruſs, or Litharge, with a fourth part of Oyl of Roſes, or
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:154333:157"/>the like, and a little Wax: Mingle therewith the Pouders that are more drying if need require.</p>
               <p>The more Violent are all cold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies that dry forceably, propounded elſewhere, to which you may add mineral Waters, of Allum and Gip, ſuch as is that of Padua, of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Sick, the Calx of Antimony very well waſhed, common Lime wel waſhed, the Calx of Vitriol, Gip, the filings of Iron often ſprinkled with Roſe Water or Plantain or the like, and dried that it may be poudered: the Scales and droſs of Iron waſhed, Lead burnt alone and waſhed, the ſhels of any Creatures burnt &amp; waſhed, all which (except Iron and other aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents propounded) are applyed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly either in the form of a Pouder, or mingled with other more mild Unguents. Hot Baths ſerve for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and to ſit in.</p>
               <p>And theſe are moſt of them Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are eaſie to provide, with which in any part of the world, and without the help of Apothecaries, any kind of Diseaſe may be cured.</p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:154333:158"/>
               <p>The way, where there is need, to mingle theſe things readily without great proviſion of Inſtruments, is not dark to be underſtood, and collected out of what hath been ſaid, and is ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here and there through the whol Book.</p>
